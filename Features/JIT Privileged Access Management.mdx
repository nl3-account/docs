## JIT PAM
Next Level3's JIT Privileged Access Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources. Next Level3's JIT Privileged Access Management is simple yet powerful tool which provides following features:
- Just In Time approval request on Azure Entra group memebership.
- Near realtime group memebership after approval.
- Time based access so group memebership is revoked after expiration.
