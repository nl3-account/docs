## User Management
All registered users are manageed from the Company Portal from the "Users" tab.

<img src="/images/User Management/User1.png" />

Here, the administrator can enable/disable account protection for associated applications and enable/disable administrative access to the Company Portal. 

When a user is unable to access their account through any of their authorized devices and they have lost their recovery key the administrator can utilize the reset account function.

## Enabling Users
### User Enablement
Next Level3 Supports two methods for enabling users, the opt in method and the automatic enrollment method.

### Opt In Method
If you wish to allow users to self service opt in and enable Next Level3 protection for their accounts you must provide the users with a link 

 
**Step 1 - Create a JWT for the User**
The User Enablement process is fairly simple. Somewhere in your application, you need to generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes the login name for the user and a few other properties including an expiration claim (more details below). The JWT will need to be signed in your backend application code with the NL3 Domain Key associated with your application. The signature will be verified on our end to ensure the request for enablement is coming from your application. Here is a sample header and payload for the JWT:

**Header**
```JSON
{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}
```

**Payload**
```JSON
{"iss":"www.myapplication.com","iat":1642525200,"exp":1674061200,"aud":"auth.nextlevel3.com","sub":"myuser@myapplication.com"}
```

### Step 2 - Add Redirect to Next LEVEL3

The next step is to add an NL3 User Enablement workflow in your application. This could be something as simple as a link that says, “Click here to enable NL3 protection”, or a checkbox on the user’s profile screen. However you choose to implement the workflow, enablement occurs when your application redirects the user or opens a new tab or browser window and passes the JWT created in Step 1 to our website in the “auth-token” query parameter (e.g. https://cloud.nextlevel3.com?auth-token=<JWT created in Step 1>). Then the user will login with an existing NL3 account or signup for a new one. This account will allow the user to link their application login with an NL3 account that they can use to manage their protected account lock statuses with.

## Group Management
Groups are managed and created in the Group Manager pane:

<img src="/images/Group Management/Group1.png" />

Groups are added by selecting the **"+ New Group"** icon in the top right-hand corner of the pane. Selecting this option will bring up the "New Group" creation page where the user can add the name and description of the group:

<img src="/images/Group Management/Group2.png" />

Once a group has been created the user can then manage the users in the group by selecting the icon or delete the group by selecting the trashcan icon in the "ACTION" column. 

Clicking the pencil icon in the action column will bring up the "Edit Group" page where the administrator can select group members by either searching for the user in the search box or using the list of users and then clicking the ">" to add the user to the group. 

Also, the administrator can choose to add all users in the list by selecting the ">>" button. 

Once the administrator is finished, clicking the "Save" option will save the changes made. 

Clicking the "Return" option will cancel any pre-saving changes made to the group and will bring you back to the Group management pane.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

    * Access to the NextLevel3 portal to an existing application with an API key.
    * Access as ‘administrator’ on the system that the module will be installed on
    * Users available for testing.

### Standard Installation
    
    1. Log into your NextLevel3 portal at https://company.nextlevel3.com/
    2. Navigate to Applications and choose the appropriate application (in this case jump-servers).
    3. Copy the application URL (in this case jump-servers.infra.company.com) somewhere you can retrieve it.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam1.png" />
    4. Next, navigate to Keys & Tokens, select the Application from step 2 and Key Type “Application Signing Keys”, then click on the Key to retrieve the Application Signing Key.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam2.png" />
    5. Copy the signing key (it may be multiple lines), and store it with the URL from earlier.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam3.png" />
    6. Download the installer from the company portal on the Windows user account you are protecting.
    7. Copy the file to the following directory: C:\Windows\System32
    8. Run the following Windows Powershell commands to create the LSA Registry entries to install sub authentication module, configure event logging, and create registry entries for sub authentication module connection to NextLevel3:
    <img src="/images/pam/pam4.png" />
    9. Depending on the endpoint application you are configuring, you will need to add the API Key, API URI, and APP URI to the registry using the following commands:
    <img src="/images/pam/pam5.png" />
    10. Restart your device, this will install the module and its configuration. This will require your account to use NextLevel3 MFA, and, if the NextLevel3 server cannot be contacted, will be denied access.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam6.png" />
    11. Confirm that you and other users can log in, especially that the appropriate connectivity and usernames are in place.

### Removal

    The module consists of Item’s and ItemProperty’s that were created during the NextLevel3 installation. You will need to run the following command to remove the module from your device.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam7.png" />

    After running the above commands you will need to restart your device for the changes to take place.

    ### Additional Configuration

    The following command can be entered to give designated users NextLevel3 MFA bypass privileges:
    <img src="/images/pam/pam8.png" />

    <Accordion title="Linux" icon="/icons/linux.svg">
## Linux

### Prerequisites

You will need:

    * Access to the NextLevel3 portal to an existing application with an API key.
    * Access as ‘root’ (directly or via su/sudo) on the system that the module will be installed on.
    * Users available for testing.

### Standard Installation

    1. Log into your NextLevel3 portal at https://company.nextlevel3.com/
    2. Navigate to Applications and choose the appropriate application (in this case jump-servers).
    3. Copy the application URL (in this case jump-servers.infra.company.com) somewhere you can retrieve it.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam1.png" />
    4. Next, navigate to Keys & Tokens, select the Application from step 2 and Key Type “Application Signing Keys”, then click on the Key to retrieve the Application Signing Key.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam2.png" />
    5. Copy the signing key (it may be multiple lines), and store it with the URL from earlier.
    <img src="/images/pam/pam3.png" />
    6. Download the installer, and copy it to the system you want to install it on.
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam1.png" />
    7. Become the root user and extract the installer to the designated folder.
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam2.png" />
    8. Run the installer, it will ask you for the information stored earlier.
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam3.png" />
    9. Next the installer shows the changes to add nextlevel3 to the PAM configuration. If you are happy with these changes, type ‘y’ and press enter.
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam4.png" />
    10. The installer will then install the module and its configuration.
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam5.png" />
    11. This will install the module with the defaults: all accounts and groups will require NextLevel3 MFA, and, if the NextLevel3 server cannot be contacted, will be denied access.
    <img src="images/pam/pam6.png" />
    12. Confirm that you and other users can log in, especially that the appropriate connectivity and usernames are in place.

### Removal

    The module consists of two files and an entry in the pam configuration. To remove it temporarily, simply remove all references to it in pam.d
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam6.png" />
    
    This shows that there is a line in /etc/pam.d/base-auth that needs to be removed.

    To remove the module entirely, remove the entries from /etc/pam.d, the configuration file /etc/nextlevel3.json and the module itself, pam_nextlevel3.so. You can find the module in:

        - Alpine: /lib/security
        - Red Hat: /usr/lib64
        - SuSE: /usr/lib64/security
        - Ubuntu: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security

### Additional Configuration

    There are three additional settings that you can change by editing the configuration file. By default this is installed as /etc/nextlevel3.json. The file created by the sample installation is below:
    <img src="images/pam/linux/pam7.png" />

    The APIKey and APPURI values were filled in by the installer. Settings that you can change are:

        - AccountTry: a list of accounts that are allowed to log in if the nextlevel3 service cannot be contacted. If the service can be contacted, MFA will occur, if it cannot be contacted they will be allowed in. This should be restricted to accounts used for “break glass” functions.
        - GroupTry: has the same behavior as AccountTry, but contains a list of groups.
        - Trace: enable tracing, leave this to false unless you are diagnosing an issue with our support team.
    
    The AccountTry and GroupTry configuration are both JSON arrays. Example values:

    ```JSON
    "AccountTry": [ "breakglass", "second-account" ]
    "GroupTry": [ "wheel", "staff" ]
    ```
