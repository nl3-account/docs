## Cyber Policies

Cyber Policies are used to control access to application accounts and managed that access for a companies users (employees, contractors, third parties and customers). There are a number of use cases for a variety of industries in which Cyber Policies provide solutions to solve problems. This document will outline each of the Cyber Policy types available today and will define how to create, use, and manage cyber policies using the Next Level3 Company Portal.

### Accessing Cyber Policies
Requirements: Admin Level Next Level3 Company Account Access.

Login to [company.nextlevel3.com](https://company.nextlevel3.com) and navigate to "Management" –> "Cyber Policies".

## Cyber Policy Creation

### Policy Types
Currently, there are three policy types supported by the Next Level3 Cloud Identity JIT Access platform including;

    - Scheduled Policies – Policies triggered at a scheduled time.
    - Multi-Approval Policies – Policies requiring more than one user to approve unlocking an account prior to account unlock.
    - Alert Policies – Policies that are triggered when an alert occurs from an external system such as an EDR, IDR, SIEM tools, or other alert eventing system.

### Scheduled Policies
Scheduled policies are used to lock and unlock accounts at a specific time. They can be scheduled to run starting on a specific date and can optionally have an end date. To create a new scheduled policy, click the add new policy button in the Policy Manager.

This will create a new policy and allow you to specify the following;

    - Policy Type: Scheduled Policy
    - Policy Name: Friendly name for the policy you are creating.
    - Start Date: The date the policy will take action.
    - End Date: Optional End date. If you do not want an end date, select the No End Date check box.
    - Frequency: Frequency at which this policy will be evaluated. (Daily, Weekly, Weekdays, BiWeekly, Monthly, Annually)
    - Action – Action the policy will take when applied
        - Allow Accounts to be Unlocked – This action will Lock Accounts but allow users to override this lock by approving an Unlock Request from the Next Level3 user portal/mobile app.
        - Unlock Accounts – Will set the user's account status to Unlocked.
        - Lock Accounts – Will set the user's account status to Locked. This will prevent the user from overriding the lock and they will not be able to unlock the account.
    - Time: The time that the policy will be executed.

### Applying Scheduled Policies
Once the Scheduled policy is created it can be applied. To apply the policy, you are selecting the list of users/group accounts that the scheduled policy will be applied to. To apply the policy, click the "Assign Groups to Policy" button on the Policy Management page for that policy.

**EXAMPLE "ASSIGN GROUPS TO POLICY" ACTION**

[policy](/images/policy3.png)

You will then need to assign users and/or groups to the policy by selecting them in the list to the left and moving them to the right by using the ">" button or assigning all users and groups by using the ">>" button.

### Alert Policies
Alert policies are designed to act as a safeguard in the event of scenarios such as:

    * An Intrusion is detected
    * Malware is detected
    * Ransomware is detected
    * Unauthorized access to a system is detected
    * Other critical security alerting scenarios

To create a new Alert policy, click the add new policy button in the Policy Manager.

    - Policy Name: Friendly name for the policy you are creating.
    - Action – Action the policy will take when applied
        - Allow Accounts to be Unlocked – This action will Lock Accounts but allow users to override this lock by approving an Unlock Request from the Next Level3 user portal/mobile app.

### Applying Alert Policies
Once the Alert policy is created it can be applied. To apply the policy, you are selecting the list of users/group accounts that the alert policy will be applied to. To apply the policy, click the "Assign Groups to Policy" button on the Policy Management page for that policy.

**EXAMPLE "ASSIGN GROUPS TO POLICY" ACTION**

[policy](/images/policy6.png)

You will then need to assign users and/or groups to the policy by selecting them in the list to the left and moving them to the right by using the ">" button or assigning all users and groups by using the ">>" button.

### Executing Alert Policies
**Manually**
Alert policies can be executed directly in the Company Management portal by clicking the execute policy link for the policy.

**EXAMPLE OF EXECUTING AN ALERT POLICY**

[policy](/images/policy8.png)

**Programmatically**
Alert policies can also be executed programmatically. To execute an alert policy programmatically you can call the Next Level3 API.

```HTML
Example API requestcurl –location –request POST ‘http://localhost:80/nl3/api/v1/sdk/policies/${POLICY_ID}/execute’ \
–header ‘x-nl3-server-api-token: ${API_TOKEN_FROM_COMPANY_PORTAL}’ \
–header ‘Content-Type: application/json’
```

### Multi-Approval Policies
Multi Approval policies enable you to define a secondary approver who must approve any unlock request for the accounts the policy is applied to. The flow works like this:

    1. John wants to login to his application using the root@mycompany.com account. John has already registered this account in his Next Level3 account and will receive an Unlock request which he must approve prior to being able to log in.
    2. The account root@mycompany.com, has a multi-approval policy applied to it which requires someone in the Central Security Group to also approve an Unlock Request prior to John being able to log in.
    3. When John attempts to login he is sent a notification to his Next Level3 app, which he must approve. Members of the Central Security Group are also sent an approval request and at least one of these members must approve the unlock. Once approved, the root@mycompany.com account is unlocked and John is able to log in using that credential.

To create a new Multi-Approval policy, click the add new policy button in the Policy Manager.

[policy](/images/policy1.png)

This will create a new policy and allow you to specify the following;

    - Policy Type: Multi-Approval Policy
    - Policy Name: Friendly name for the policy you are creating.
    - Action – Action the policy will take when applied
        - Allow Accounts to be Unlocked – This action will Lock Accounts but allow users to override this lock by approving an Unlock Request from the Next Level3 user portal/mobile app.
        - Unlock Accounts – Will set the user's account status to Unlocked.
        - Lock Accounts – Will set the user's account status to Locked. This will prevent the user from overriding the lock and they will not be able to unlock the account.

**EXAMPLE MULTI-APPROVAL POLICY**

### Applying Multi-Approval Policies

Once the Multi-Approval policy is created it can be applied. To apply the policy, you are selecting the list of users/group accounts for which secondary approval will be required prior to unlocking. To apply the policy, click the Assign Groups to Policy button on the Policy Management page for that policy.

[policy](/images/policy10.png)

You will then need to assign users and/or groups to the policy by selecting them in the list to the left and moving them to the right by using the ">" button or assigning all users and groups by using the ">>" button.
